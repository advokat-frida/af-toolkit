# HANDOFF

## 2026-08-31 - Consolidation + the approved redesign

Ben's call: one repository. The five tool sources moved in as top-level folders (safeseed,
redactorium, privacy-wizards-council, build-a-prompt, objection-oracle); the standalone repos are
superseded and await Ben's separate archive decision. The old cross-repo sync
(`scripts/sync-tools.mjs`) was replaced by `scripts/build-tools.mjs`, which stages each folder's
built artifact with schemaVersion-3 provenance.

The approved Claude Design package *Toolkit - Redesign* was implemented in full:

- Shell: sidebar brand cap (fox mark), grouped navigation (Manage data / Decide / Work with AI),
  grouped Home cards (numbers, accent hues, card buttons, and the AF header tile retired), 56px
  breadcrumb tool headers, changelog as one bottom line.
- Tools restyled at the source, each with a native embed mode (`?embed=1`) replacing the CSS
  adapters: SafeSeed staged generate flow with preset pills + dotted assurance labels + stat band +
  receipt language; Build-A-Prompt lands directly in the composer; Privacy Wizards chooser rows +
  one-question flow + verdict-block determinations (and it posts its active determination into the
  shell breadcrumb); Objection Oracle five-questions-in-one-list + verdict ruling (new embed build
  target restored); Redactorium centered drop zone, 4a findings table, 4b record state.
- The design package became standing law: docs/design/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md + REVIEW-GATE.md, enforced
  mechanically by scripts/design-gate.mjs inside `npm run gate`.

Verified: design gate clean; static QA 123/123; rendered QA green at all four viewports with fresh
proofs/; tool gates green (safeseed 127 lib tests + chrome verification, bap 19 + audits, pwc 17 +
audits, oracle 33 + full browser harness). Working-tree state reviewed but NOT committed - the tuck
gate is Ben's.

Known follow-ups: redactorium/frontend has no package-lock.json (node_modules copied verbatim from
the pre-consolidation install; generate a lockfile deliberately); the objection-oracle folder
carried in the uncommitted content-refinement WIP (question wording, trimmed response banks,
RUBRIC_VERSION) from its old working tree - kept intentionally; SafeSeed UI now says "receipt"
(downloads `.receipt.json`) while the library/SPEC keep "run record" naming; the superseded GitHub
repos still exist until Ben archives them.

## 2026-08-27 - Private repository graduation

The reviewed Toolkit candidate graduated from `studio/active` into the dedicated `the-toolkit`
integration-shell repository. The shell owns Home, navigation, visual adapters, local serving,
provenance, and QA. The five integrated tools remain source-owned in their individual repositories.

The current release boundary is private source control only. No website sync, Ghost change, theme
deployment, public release, DNS, analytics, or package publication is part of this checkpoint.

Next change: update a tool in its source repository, review and commit that source build, run the
explicit Toolkit sync, then repeat the full static, rendered, and literal visual gate.
